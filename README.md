### Abstract 
This study aims to measure the real exchange rate sensitivity of the current accounts balance of Bangladesh based on yearly data from 1976 to 2020. We deploy a constructed proxy variable based on the theoretical basis to substitute for real exchange rate growth. Using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), we find a non-significant close to zero long-run impact of real exchange rate on current accounts balance. However, the short-run impact is highly significant and positive. The analysis suggests an extremely inelastic, positive, and non-significant long-run relationship between the real exchange rate and current accounts balance. The forecasts from VECM estimates put the COVID-19 recovery by the economy within 2030. The study proposes some recommendations, including improving institutional quality, export diversification, independent monetary policy setting, and a floating exchange rate regime.

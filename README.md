# Real Exchange Rate and Current Account Balance: Empirical Evidence from Bangladesh (1976-2020)

This paper aims to study the effect of real exchange rate, along with and in presence of other appropriate variables, on current accounts balance of Bangladesh on the basis of data from 1976 to 2020. The Cochrane-Orcutt AR(1) hierarchical multiple regression analysis, using a new ad hoc proxy real exchange rate variable constructed with nominal exchange rate, home and world GDP deflator data, suggests that there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between real exchange rate and current accounts balance. The result suggests maintaining a stable current accounts balance requires extremely close monitoring and management of government into the foreign exchange market and domestic commodity markets.
